I am an enthusiast of traveling the world, photographing, climbing, running, cycling, rowing, javascript, python, machine learning, artificial intelligence and the stock exchange.

I am very happy and lucky because I married a wonderful woman and, like me, she loves to travel. Together we made an instagram of travel [nossas rotas](https://www.instagram.com/nossasrotas/). Countries we've been to: [Nossas Rotas Map](https://nossasrotas.firebaseapp.com).

This blog is fully developed with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and it's ðŸ’¯% [open source](https://github.com/albertoivo/albertoivo.github.io). Please feel free to contribute (by clicking **Edit this page** at the end of each post) or comment/ask anything as well. I will reply as soon as possible.
