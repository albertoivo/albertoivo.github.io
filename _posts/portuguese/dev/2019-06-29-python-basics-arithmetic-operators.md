Python has several artithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`, `//`

- `+` Addition

```python
>>> print(3 + 2)
5
```

- `-` Subtraction

```python
>>> print(3 - 2)
1
```

- `*` Multiplication

```python
>>> print(3 * 2)
6
```

- `/` Division

```python
>>> print(9 / 2)
4.5
```

- `%` Mod (the remainder after dividing)

```python
>>> print(9 % 2)
1
```

- `**` Exponentiation (note that `^` does not do this operation, as you might have seen in other languages)

```python
>>> print(3 ** 2)
9
```

- `//` Divides and rounds down to the nearest integer

```python
>>> print(9 // 2)
4
```
